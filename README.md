This is a quick project which lets you play a basic version of 3d tic tac toe with spikes, with the variant that the true center cannot be used to win.

It also includes a DFS in a webworker which determines that whoever goes first in 3x3x3 spike tic-tac-toe with this same variant always wins with perfect play.
